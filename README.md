# Sonic 1 AS Disassembly: Project 128 Edition
This branch is based off Sonic 1: Project 128 by MarkeyJester, which converts the collision and chunks to work with the Sonic 2 Format (128x128 Chunks and 2 Collision Sets).
It also features further improvements to make the collision even closer to the Sonic 2 system.
